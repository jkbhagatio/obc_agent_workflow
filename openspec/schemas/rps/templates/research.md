# Research: <change-title>

## Context

- What part of the repo does this touch?
- Why is this change being considered?
- What constraints exist (runtime, memory, dependencies, submission environment, etc.)?

## Prior art / standards

> Focus on existing implementations and standards. If you cite external tools/standards, include
> references.

### Relevant papers / docs / standards

- <reference 1> — <1–2 sentence summary>
- <reference 2> — <1–2 sentence summary>

### Relevant repos / implementations

- <repo/tool 1> — <what's relevant; key design ideas>
- <repo/tool 2> — <what's relevant; key design ideas>

## Library / package survey (Python)

> Identify candidate packages and tradeoffs. Prefer minimal dependency footprint unless
> justified.

- <package 1> — <why it helps; risks/cost>
- <package 2> — <why it helps; risks/cost>

## Performance characteristics

- Runtime hotspots / scaling considerations:
    - <e.g., O(N^2) attention, IO bandwidth, etc.>
- Memory considerations:
    - <e.g., batching, caching, activation size, etc.>

## Risks / unknowns

- <risk 1>
- <risk 2>
- <open question 1>

## Recommendation

- Recommended approach: <option / direction>
- Why: <1–3 bullets>
- Alternatives considered: <brief>
